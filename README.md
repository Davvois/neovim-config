# neovim-config
This is my NeoVim config with some vim-plug plugins. <br>
As I marked them in the "init.vim" file, some plugins <br>
are more complicated to install; I added some comments with the <br>
specific components that you need to install to let the plugin work. <br>
I hope this config satisfies your likings.

# NOTE
Whenever you pasted the config, execute ":PluginInstall" to <br>
install all the plugins
